# Progress

Each day I use a different programming language.

## Day 1 - APL

Oh my god, APL uses nice concepts - working with arrays, but it is so much pain to work with. I was never sure if the font displays the character
correctly; I had to copy and paste everything. If only the functions were a bit more descriptive and shape more visible (I bet you can set it but I
did not figure it out). I did not attempt to learn how to define my own functions though.

The language was a good match for the task. As with most languages the ain problem was the IO - reading a file is apparently not very standardized
between APL implementations.

## Day 2 - Io

I chose a high-level languages because the task looked simple but something I could model as objects. I often encountered situations when the language
did not point out an error - it just did something - or nothing. I love languages based on simple principles. Io has a good documentation and guide.
Finding `asNumber`, `String split` and `File` in the guide made me happy as these are common issues which differ between all languages.

The most cumbersome part was that only one version of `if` returns value. Being able to easily define two submarines with different behavior shows the
strength of the prototype-based inheritance.

## Day 3 - LDPL

LDPL was a pleasant surprise.
It has a nice documentation with examples; it has a well-defined IO and simple data types.
The biggest disadvantage is its verbosity; you need to define a new variable and write a statement just to increase a variable by one.
The division of data and procedure is cumbersome.
Some keywords seem to be superfluous - such as `with`.
The inspiration of the old languages like `COBOL` or `BASIC` is clear, but it does not feel obsolete - probably due to the good design of data types.

The task itself was simple.
There was almost no need to work with binary numbers.
As the language of my choice did not support conversion of bases, I had to implement binary to decimal myself quite trivially.
